Ricochet Solver
---------------

This project was a project I worked on to get back into coding and because I thought it'd be fun to solve Ricohet Robot.

Next Steps
----------
1.    UI for board creation/results viewing - right now you have to type them in by hand.
2.    Breadth first search implementation - I'd like to try implementing a breadth first search
3.    Easy perf comparison - necessary to see whether breadth first or depth first search is faster :)
